# Concert Ticket Booking Application with SQL

## Overview
This project is a client-server concert ticket booking application designed to teach the fundamentals of SQL databases. The application allows users to apply for concert tickets while demonstrating how to manage and query data using SQL. The server interacts with a database to store ticket availability, user details, and booking information, providing hands-on experience with SQL database operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Sockets**: Enables network communication between the client and server.
- **JavaFX**: Provides an intuitive and interactive GUI for the client.
- **SQL Database**: Manages ticket booking, user data, and concert details.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Facilitates interaction between Java and the SQL database.
- **Multithreading**: Supports multiple client connections.

## Features
- 📡 Real-time communication between client and server.
- 🎟️ Apply for concert tickets through the client interface.
- 🗄️ SQL database integration for managing tickets and user data.
- 🔄 Multi-client support using threading.
- 📝 Learn SQL fundamentals like data insertion, querying, and updates.

## SQL Database Fundamentals Covered
- 📌 **Creating Tables**: Defining schema for concerts, users, and ticket bookings.
- 📌 **Inserting Data**: Storing new users and ticket requests.
- 📌 **Querying Data**: Retrieving ticket availability and booking details.
- 📌 **Updating Records**: Modifying ticket status upon purchase.
